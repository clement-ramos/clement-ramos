<h1>About Me</h1> 

IT is as much a passion as a job, so I really don't count the hours spent on it.My main objectives right now is to increase my skills to be more versatile.I'm a french student located in the south of France and if I'm not coding you'll probably find me at the gym or hanging out with my friends
